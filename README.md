# 🧙‍♂️ WZRD Studio - Cross-Chain Generative AI & Self-Sovereign Verification

![WZRD Studio](public/og-image.png)

## 🏆 ETHSF Hackathon Submission

WZRD Studio is a next-generation platform that merges AI-generated content with blockchain technology while prioritizing user privacy through zero-knowledge verification. Our platform enables creators to deploy intelligent agents that can autonomously interact with governance systems while maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance.

## 💎 Key Features

### 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Age Verification

We've implemented a privacy-preserving age verification system using Self Protocol that allows users to prove they're 18+ without revealing their actual birthdate or identity:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Users verify age requirements without exposing personal data
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users maintain full control of their identity information
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Verification works across multiple blockchains
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Easy integration for Web3 applications

### 🤖 Fully Autonomous Agent DAO

- **Governance-Powered Agents**: AI agents that execute decisions based on token holder votes
- **Community-Driven Development**: Accept new function calls and integrations from the community
- **Bounty System**: Agents create bounties for lore, media, songs, and ecosystem growth
- **Treasury Management**: Autonomous treasury growth through DeFi integration

### 🔄 Cross-Chain Functionality

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Seamlessly interact with Ethereum, Base, Solana, and more
- **Universal dApp Architecture**: Consistent experience across different blockchain networks
- **Chain-Agnostic Wallets**: Connect and interact regardless of blockchain preference
- **Single Interface**: Manage assets, verify identity, and create content across all supported chains

### 🎭 AI Integration

- **Creative Agent Deployment**: Deploy AI agents specialized in art, music, writing, and more
- **Personalized NFT Gallery**: AI-curated NFT selections based on user preferences
- **Intelligent Treasury Management**: AI-optimized investment and growth strategies
- **Content Generation**: Create multimedia content through natural language prompts

### 🪙 Tokenization & DeFi Tools

- **RWA Tokenization**: Convert real-world assets into on-chain tokens
- **One-Click DeFi Ecosystem**: Instantly create LP pools, lending markets, and more
- **Token Deployment Manager**: Streamlined token creation and management
- **NFT to Physical Conversion**: Print physical copies of digital assets using API webhooks

## 🚀 Technical Architecture

WZRD Studio is built on a modular architecture that combines:

1. **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for a clean, intuitive UX
2. **Backend**: Supabase for database and serverless functions
3. **Blockchain Integration**: OnchainKit for easy cross-chain compatibility
4. **Identity Layer**: Self Protocol for zero-knowledge proofs
5. **AI Layer**: Integration with state-of-the-art generative AI models

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Age Verification**: Users verify their age through our Self Protocol integration, generating zero-knowledge proofs without revealing sensitive information
2. **Agent Creation**: Create and deploy AI agents with specific capabilities across multiple blockchains
3. **Community Governance**: Token holders vote on agent behaviors and features
4. **Bounty System**: Complete tasks and earn rewards for contributing to the ecosystem
5. **Asset Management**: Create, manage, and trade tokenized assets across chains

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- **Content Creators**: Deploy AI agents to generate and monetize content with age-appropriate access
- **DAOs**: Implement secure, privacy-preserving voting and governance systems
- **DeFi Platforms**: Enable regulatory-compliant access to financial services
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Ensure age-appropriate content with privacy-first verification
- **RWA Tokenization**: Convert physical assets to digital tokens with verified ownership

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Zero-Knowledge Age Verification Circuit

```typescript
// Simplified implementation of our ZK verification system
const verifyAge = async (proof: Proof, publicSignals: PublicSignals) => {
  // Extract user ID from the public signals
  const userId = extractUserId(publicSignals);
  
  // Verify the zero-knowledge proof without accessing the actual birthdate
  const verificationResult = await selfVerifier.verify(proof, publicSignals);
  
  if (verificationResult.isValid) {
    // User is verified as 18+ without revealing actual age
    return { verified: true, userId };
  }
  
  return { verified: false };
};
```

### Cross-Chain Integration

```typescript
// Example of our cross-chain functionality
const deployAgent = async (agentConfig, blockchains: string[]) => {
  // Deploy the same agent across multiple blockchains
  const deployments = await Promise.all(
    blockchains.map(async (chain) => {
      const provider = getProviderForChain(chain);
      return deployAgentToChain(agentConfig, provider);
    })
  );
  
  return {
    deploymentIds: deployments.map(d => d.id),
    transactionHashes: deployments.map(d => d.txHash)
  };
};
```
