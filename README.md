![WZRD Studio](public/og-image.png)

## 🏆 ETHSF Hackathon Submission

WZRD Studio is a next-generation platform that merges AI-generated content with blockchain technology while prioritizing user privacy through zero-knowledge verification. Our platform enables creators to deploy intelligent agents that can autonomously interact with governance systems while maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance.

## 💎 Key Features

### 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Age Verification

We've implemented a privacy-preserving age verification system using Self Protocol that allows users to prove they're 18+ without revealing their actual birthdate or identity:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Users verify age requirements without exposing personal data
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users maintain full control of their identity information
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Verification works across multiple blockchains
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Easy integration for Web3 applications

### 🏗️ Built on Base

WZRD Studio is proudly built on Base, leveraging its robust infrastructure for:

- **Performance**: Lightning-fast transaction speeds with minimal gas fees
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with the reliability of the Coinbase ecosystem
- **Developer Tools**: Rich toolkit for rapid, streamlined development
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum's developer ecosystem
- **Scalability**: Designed for mass adoption with optimized L2 scaling

### 🔄 Universal Crossmint On-Chain Actions

Our integration with Crossmint enables seamless cross-chain operations:

- **One-Click Cross-Chain NFT Minting**: Create NFTs across multiple blockchains simultaneously
- **Gasless Transactions**: Users can interact without needing native tokens for gas
- **Email/Social Login**: Web2 user experience with Web3 functionality
- **Chain-Agnostic Actions**: Execute the same on-chain actions regardless of blockchain
- **Credit Card Payment Gateway**: Allow users to purchase NFTs with traditional payment methods

### 🤖 Fully Autonomous Agent DAO

- **Governance-Powered Agents**: AI agents that execute decisions based on token holder votes
- **Community-Driven Development**: Accept new function calls and integrations from the community
- **Bounty System**: Agents create bounties for lore, media, songs, and ecosystem growth
- **Treasury Management**: Autonomous treasury growth through DeFi integration

### 🔄 Cross-Chain Functionality

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Seamlessly interact with Ethereum, Base, Solana, and more
- **Universal dApp Architecture**: Consistent experience across different blockchain networks
- **Chain-Agnostic Wallets**: Connect and interact regardless of blockchain preference
- **Single Interface**: Manage assets, verify identity, and create content across all supported chains

### 🎭 AI Integration

- **Creative Agent Deployment**: Deploy AI agents specialized in art, music, writing, and more
- **Personalized NFT Gallery**: AI-curated NFT selections based on user preferences
- **Intelligent Treasury Management**: AI-optimized investment and growth strategies
- **Content Generation**: Create multimedia content through natural language prompts

### 🪙 Tokenization & DeFi Tools

- **RWA Tokenization**: Convert real-world assets into on-chain tokens
- **One-Click DeFi Ecosystem**: Instantly create LP pools, lending markets, and more
- **Token Deployment Manager**: Streamlined token creation and management
- **NFT to Physical Conversion**: Print physical copies of digital assets using API webhooks

## 🚀 Technical Architecture

WZRD Studio is built on a modular architecture that combines:

1. **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for a clean, intuitive UX
2. **Backend**: Supabase for database and serverless functions
3. **Blockchain Integration**: OnchainKit and Crossmint for easy cross-chain compatibility
4. **Base Integration**: Leveraging Base for optimized L2 performance and Coinbase ecosystem
5. **Identity Layer**: Self Protocol for zero-knowledge proofs
6. **AI Layer**: Integration with state-of-the-art generative AI models

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Base Blockchain Operations**: Core smart contracts and tokenization built on Base for optimal performance
2. **Age Verification**: Users verify their age through our Self Protocol integration, generating zero-knowledge proofs without revealing sensitive information
3. **Crossmint Integration**: Seamless cross-chain interactions through Crossmint's Universal Actions API
4. **Agent Creation**: Create and deploy AI agents with specific capabilities across multiple blockchains
5. **Community Governance**: Token holders vote on agent behaviors and features
6. **Bounty System**: Complete tasks and earn rewards for contributing to the ecosystem
7. **Asset Management**: Create, manage, and trade tokenized assets across chains

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- **Content Creators**: Deploy AI agents to generate and monetize content with age-appropriate access
- **DAOs**: Implement secure, privacy-preserving voting and governance systems
- **DeFi Platforms**: Enable regulatory-compliant access to financial services
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Ensure age-appropriate content with privacy-first verification
- **RWA Tokenization**: Convert physical assets to digital tokens with verified ownership

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Base Integration

```typescript
// Example of deploying an agent on Base
import { BaseProvider } from '@coinbase/onchainkit';

const deployAgentOnBase = async (agentConfig) => {
  const baseProvider = new BaseProvider(process.env.BASE_RPC_URL);
  
  // Deploy agent to Base L2
  const baseDeployment = await baseContract.connect(baseProvider).deployAgent(
    agentConfig.name,
    agentConfig.purpose,
    agentConfig.capabilities
  );
  
  return {
    chain: 'base',
    deploymentId: baseDeployment.id,
    transactionHash: baseDeployment.txHash
  };
};
```

### Crossmint Universal Actions

```typescript
// Example of using Crossmint for cross-chain NFT minting
import { Crossmint } from '@crossmint/client-sdk-react-ui';

const mintAcrossChains = async (metadata, targetChains) => {
  // Configure Crossmint to work with multiple chains
  const crossmintClient = new Crossmint.CrossmintAPIClient({
    apiKey: process.env.CROSSMINT_API_KEY,
  });
  
  // Mint the same NFT across multiple chains
  const mintResults = await Promise.all(
    targetChains.map(chain => 
      crossmintClient.mintNFT({
        chain: chain,
        metadata: metadata,
        recipient: userWalletAddress,
      })
    )
  );
  
  return mintResults;
};
```

### Zero-Knowledge Age Verification Circuit

```typescript
// Simplified implementation of our ZK verification system
const verifyAge = async (proof: Proof, publicSignals: PublicSignals) => {
  // Extract user ID from the public signals
  const userId = extractUserId(publicSignals);
  
  // Verify the zero-knowledge proof without accessing the actual birthdate
  const verificationResult = await selfVerifier.verify(proof, publicSignals);
  
  if (verificationResult.isValid) {
    // User is verified as 18+ without revealing actual age
    return { verified: true, userId };
  }
  
  return { verified: false };
};
```
